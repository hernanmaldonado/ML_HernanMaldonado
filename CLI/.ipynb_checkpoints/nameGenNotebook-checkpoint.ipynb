    "This notebook walks you through the creation of the name generator and presents the logic behind its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of this project is to generate names that sound as if they could have been real names but most, not all, are names that are not regularly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original makemore Andrej Karpathy looks at the probability that any combination of two letter occur (bigrams) in a name. \n",
    "For example in my name: Hernan would be separated in the follwing bigrams as *H, he, er, rn, na, an, n~, using * as a marker to start the word and ~ as a marker to end the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "From my point of view that approach is not very effective because it underestimates the fact that it is not the same to get er on different positions of a name, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eric, Erin, Erik, Erica, Erika, Erick, Ernesto  have er as the first two letters but\n",
    "Hermes, Hermman, Berenice, Derrick have er on the second and third position. \n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at those examples I wondered if the next letter depends on the position er occupy in the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to try a graph to capture the probability of a letter in any a specific position to have any other letter as the following character of the name. This gives the name generator more information about the way humans create names making it better at guessiong names that sounds acceptable.  "
